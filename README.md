<H1>Hirst Painting</H1>

<H2>Turtle Graphics in Python</H2>
I used code to filter out shades of light and dark colours from the extracted colours prior to pasting the RGB list.
<p>
<p>
I get inputs from the user for dot size, spacing, number of dots in x and y axis. Then I size the screen appropriately to correctly centre the grid.
<p>
I used absolute positioning of the turtle, to paint the dots on the x-y grid in only 4 lines of code, and then hide the turtle.
<p>
Anybody want to bid for my painting? Going cheap starting at only Â£1M...
